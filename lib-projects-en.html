<p>At the same time, the projects of the libraries reflect the changes arising from on-line technologies, digitalisation of library resources, increase in the information volume and new opportunities for remote access to them. The task of the libraries in the 21st century is to search for new functions, which shall make it possible to collect and classify this huge volume of data, and use modern technology in the process so that each of us can discover the rich cultural heritage in comfort, anywhere and at any time.</p>

<h3>Knihovny.cz</h3>

<p>The common portal of the Czech libraries will enable you to get a book or other documents, which are offered by the libraries and other subjects.&nbsp;Apart from the library resources, the portal at a single point also concentrates other library and information services through which it is possible to use a given library without physically visiting it.</p>

<h3>Uniform Information Gateway</h3>

<p>The Uniform Information Gateway (JIB) is a joint project of the National Library of the Czech Republic and Charles University in Prague targeted at unification of heterogeneous information resources. The Uniform Information Gateway is a portal that has been used since 2002 for searching through bibliographical records. It makes it possible from a single point to access the Czech and foreign catalogues of the libraries, union catalogues, databases and other information resources. At the same time, you can use this portal to search for full document texts, book reviews or order electronic delivery of the document. JIB also provides information about the existence of resources that are not freely accessible.</p>

<h3>eBooks on Demand</h3>

<p>The eBooks on Demand (EOD) service is already offered by many leading European libraries including several libraries in the Czech Republic. It is used to order digital copies of historical books from the library resources. It is possible to digitalise books that are already no longer protected under the Copyright Act, i.e. if 70 years has already lapsed since the death of the given author. Thanks to digitalisation, historical books thus become easily accessible to researchers from all over the world. In the Czech Republic, the participants in the EOD services are the National Technical Library, Science Library in Olomouc, Moravian Library in Brno, and the Library of the Academy of Sciences of the Czech Republic. Also accessible are the digital copies of resources from their partner libraries.</p>
